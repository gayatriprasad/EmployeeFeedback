# EmployeeFeedback
Streamlining HR processes through NLP-driven Employee Feedback Analysis

## Aim of the project

We want to revolutionize HR processes by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze employee feedback data. This can empower HR departments to make data-driven decisions, optimize employee experiences, and create a productive work environment.

Some of the tasks Iâ€™ll work on in this project are topic modeling, sentiment analysis and text summarization.
